# conky

The file `.conkyrc` must exists in the users home folder. This conkyrc is very special. A lot of things are hard coded.

Make sure that wifi is enabled and you interface identifier is `wlo1`. You also need to install docker on your machine to use the docker section. The font used in this conkyrc is `SFMono Light`.
